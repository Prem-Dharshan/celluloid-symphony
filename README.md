### Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-Dharshan/celluloid-symphony.git

2. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following content

   ```

3. Run the project starter script:

   This script does the following:

   - Creates a virtual environment named `venv`.
   - Activates the virtual environment.
   - Installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
   - Changes directory to `CSbackend`.
   - Sources the `.env` file.

4. After running the script, you'll be in the virtual environment with all dependencies installed and environment variables set up.

## Running the Server

To start the Django development server, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
or 

Run the server starter script:
   ```bash
   bash start_server.sh
   ```
This script does the following:

   - Sources the necessary environment variables.
   - The system check framework is used to inspect the entire Django project for common problem and all apps will be checked.
   - If no issues, the development server is started.

You can now access the Django project at `http://localhost:8001/`.
